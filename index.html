        <div class="favorite-food">
            <h3>Favorite food - Ampalaya with egg</h3>
            <p> Ampalaya or bitter gourd is often something that are not really a want for the majority of people but for me if Ampalaya is prepared properly it is not even that bitter and if you add eggs then yeah it turns to something I would be willing to eat every other day or maybe even everyday hehe</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Favorite-book">
            <h3>Favorite book - The Legendary Mechanic or The Mech Touch</h3>
            <p>Reading is something of a hobby of mine and the main reason being is that I have somehow lost the appetite to watch movies or read manga or watch anime </p>
